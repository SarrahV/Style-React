# How to Style in React and Not Lose Friends

Aside from our most recent presidential election, I don't know another topic that is sure to cause more heated debate than how you should style React components. This workshop sets out to cover the main methods for styling in React (and beyond). 


Through live code exercises, we will explore the pros and cons of just some of the methods out there. You will learn to make styling decisions based on the scale of a project. By the end you should feel confident that there is hope! You can style React components without losing friends.

Part One. We will slowly start replacing the CSS with inline style objects.
